# Mushroom-Classification-Logistic-Regression-vs.-Deep-Neural-Network-MLP-
This repository contains a classification project focused on identifying whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its characteristics. The project uses two machine learning approaches: Logistic Regression and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
